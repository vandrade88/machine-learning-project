San Francisco - Oceanfront share at Ocean Beach.It is a 2 Bedroom 2 Bathroom fully furnished and equipped condo to be shared with a late 30’s GAM, along with his partner who will actually be spending most of the next 12 months or longer living in a secondary residence on the east coast to be closer to work. So mostly for your new roommate, we are looking for one nice LGBT-friendly person. The Ideal roommate does not work from home or bring the party home. It is a comfortable shoeless home to be shared by pretty much just the two of you who will share all of the common space.Big open living area with a fully stocked and equipped modern kitchen. There is a large outdoor, Oceanfront courtyard with a BBQ, and a gym/exercise room shared by all residents of the complex. Huge views of the beach and ocean from our Great Room Windows.

Our neighbors are the Golden Gate Park, The Sutro Dunes, Sutro Heights Park, Sutro Baths, and Lands end. We are surrounded by the best natural beauty that San Francisco has to offer.Available is your bedroom (pictured here), and what will be your own adjacent full bath at a cost of $1575.

What sets this share apart is how nice and comfortably furnished every room is, and how much space there is to be shared by pretty much just the two of you easy to get along with roommates. This roommate share has just come available. Preference is given to a long-term roommate share situation. Although there is not a dog living here now, a roommate who does have one, already house trained, might be considered.

308,2021-06-04 16:17:00,Portola District,1220,4,3.0,1600.0,house,w/d in unit,street parking,no,no,no,"Nice 12x12 room in big, comfortable 4BR/3BA home - Available now!","Hey everyone! Hope you’re all enjoying the transition to a (mostly) post-COVID San Francisco summer. We have a room *now available* for move-in, in our 4 bed / 3 bath two-story house in the Excelsior/Portola neighborhood, OR for move-in as late as July 1st or any date in between (we're flexible). We're looking for the right person to join our lovely and pleasant house!THE ROOM:- roughly 12’ x 12’, with one corner of the otherwise-square room “cut off” diagonally to accommodate the entry door- on the second floor, where most of the house’s living areas and bedrooms are located- attractive hardwood floors (as with the rest of the second floor)- lots of AM and afternoon sun, as the windows face Felton Street to the south/southeast- large closet/storage space, approx 4’ x 4’ in size, which is in addition to the room measurements described above- No private bath, BUT the main bath is shared with only one other person as one of the other upstairs bedrooms has its own bathroom- Note that the pictures of the room here include the departing tenant’s furnishings, which they will be taking with them, so the room will be totally clean and clear for your belongingsTHE HOUSE:- 4 bed / 3 bath, 1600 sq.ft. The house was remodeled maybe ten years ago now so everything feels relatively contemporary, which is often not the case for apartments or homes for rent in San Francisco- *Lots* of common living space, which includes a large living room area, dining room, and sizeable, pleasant, and full-featured kitchen- The main bathroom (which this tenant would use, sharing with one other housemate) is pretty large, nice, and clean!- Pretty hardwood floors- Relatively recent/new-ish appliances - fridge and freezer, electric stovetop cooking and convection oven, microwave, dishwasher (not always a guarantee in SF), large sink with built-in garbage disposal, and most importantly… WASHER AND DRYER in the garage. No more saving quarters for laundry! We even have a printer for everyone's use. No, we didn't think we'd need one either, until we did.- Some nice couch potato amenities: gigabit fiber wireless internet (I believe this is the fastest home internet available in SF), Google TV/Chromecast, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc.- 2 car garage, which unfortunately isn’t available for parking as we rent it out to friend of the house J so that he can use it to work on his car occasionally, which also reduces all of our rents a little bit (this is already factored into the rent listed below). Some storage space is still available in the garage. Anyway, don’t worry about parking though, because…- Street parking is free and relatively plentiful. Those of us with cars basically never have problems parking directly outside the house.- Cute backyard patio area with lemon tree, apple tree, and gas grill for BBQing and hanging out outside when the weather is nice- We are on top of a big hill, so we have a *great* view of Bernal Hill to the north with Downtown SF peeking out behind, and the SF Bay to the east. On a clear day you can see all the way to Oakland and spot the loading cranes in the Port of Oakland.- Sorry, no pets =(THE NEIGHBORHOOD:- A pretty residential area, with a couple schools in the area, on the border of the Excelsior and Portola neighborhoods in San Francisco.- Very close access to the 280 and 101 freeways - maybe 5-7 minutes for each?- *One block away* from an entrance to John McLaren Park, which is the second largest park in SF and features several great walking routes, picnic areas, sports and recreation courts, and scenic views of the city. Being so close to such a big, nice park was a real lifesaver during the pandemic lockdown, and is still really nice now!- Two corner stores within a seven-minute walk, one of which is very well known for its excellent deli sandwiches and extensive beer, wine, and spirits selection- The SFMTA 54 bus line stops half a block away. Get to Mission St. and Geneva Ave. in 8 minutes, and to Balboa Park BART in 10-12.- The SFMTA 44 bus line stops 3 blocks away. Get to Mission St. and Silver Ave. in 5 minutes, or Glen Park BART in 10 minutes. Also useful to getting to the western part of SF, Golden Gate Park, etc.- Nearest major commercial corridors are Geneva Ave near Mission (the closest), the stretch of Mission St. through the Excelsior and Bernal Heights, and Glen Park (near Glen Park BART), all relatively close.THE HOUSEMATES:- Two guys (R and B) and one lady (M) in their 30s - B and M early 30s, R late 30s.- Master tenant (that's me, R) works in an administrative position for the University of California system. B recently retired from a long career as a ballet dancer but still teaches dance, and is involved in choreography and other related creative pursuits. M works in an administrative position for a biomedical company.- We are all pretty low key, chilled out, and respectful, and are happy to hang out together on occasion or chat about house stuff when we need to (though generally this is pretty rare). Back in the Before Times we all had very different schedules and didn’t see each other very much, though the pandemic obviously changed that. R and M work from home full time now, and B does sometimes too. This may change again in the next several months depending on when our offices open up again. Though we do see more of each other now, this house is big enough that it hasn’t been an issue at all. Remarkably, we have had basically no issues all being stuck here under quarantine - it has been a surprisingly pleasant past year given everything else going on.- We would very much like to keep it that way with the new housemate! We are ideally looking for someone who is more-or-less in the same mind state about group living as we are and is looking for the relaxing and comfortable kind of living situation that we have created here.COST AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFO:- Rent: $1,220/month. Rent is due to the master tenant by the 5th of each month.- Deposit: $1,200 due at signing. Less than one month’s rent, sweet!- Amount due upon lease signing: $1,220 (first month's rent) + $1,200 (deposit) = $2,420- Utilities generally around $125-150 per person per month. These include water, gas and electricity, trash, recycling, and compost, and and fiber internet.- Term: the new tenant would sign a month-to-month sublease with me (R), the master tenant. We are definitely looking for someone who is interested in staying for the long term, but if it doesn’t work out for whatever reason, you won’t be locked into a year-long lease.--That’s about it for the house info, so I’ll close by reiterating that this is a *very* nice, comfortable, well-equipped house (a real house, with all the amenities) - in a good location with cool and low-key housemates that are easy to get along with and will mostly stay out of your hair. The pandemic hasn’t been easy for any of us, but I think all of us here have been very happy that things have gone so well here over the past year and a half, at least as far as the house is concerned. And as things start to open up again, it’ll be great to get back to “normal” a little more. The room opening up is a great opportunity for someone who is looking for a new place to live that would value this kind of environment.If you’ve read this far and think that this might be the room for you, please email me to tell us a little bit about yourself, what your lifestyle is like, what you’re looking for in a living situation, your job/financial situation/ability to pay rent on an ongoing basis, etc. Just click the big ""Reply"" button at the top of this listing to get in touch. If we feel you are potentially a good match, we will get in touch to set up an interview/house tour. While we can provide an initial “virtual” tour for good candidates who are planning on moving here from out of town, we *will* need everyone else to visit the house in-person to give us a chance to meet you, check out the room and house yourself, and demonstrate that you’re serious about your interest, before we make any decisions. We are all now fully-vaccinated, but can wear masks during house visits if you prefer. Sorry for the hassle, we just think this is an important part of ensuring everyone’s compatibility and making sure you’re serious about the room.Anyway, please feel free to email with any questions about the room, the house, or any of us - I will try to respond ASAP! We are looking forward to meeting you, and offering the room to you if we think you’re the right person. Thanks!

When you walk into this home, you can’t help but be surprised. In the sunniest part of the City, Potrero Hill, you’ll find this truly a one-of-a-kind home. (where) Here, award-winning California Architect, Karyn Shore, transformed the upper levels of a typical 1895 Victorian into a jaw-dropping, two-story, industrial loft. Designed unlike any ordinary seismic upgrade, the living room is surrounded by a steel box frame beam with trusses above; handmade flat work and frosted glass railings and an art deco inspired spiral staircase leading to the large loft space above. Since this Victorian towers above it’s neighbors, the main floor is afforded with tall original windows on 3 sides that let in plenty of light. The living room is expansive with window views to the west and sunsets and a 25 foot peaked ceiling with aero fan, opening up to the loft. The adjacent bedroom has original pocket doors, antique light fixture, built in bookcase and period wood trim and picture rail. The main floor bathroom is bright and features detailed hexagonal-tiled floor, blue glass ‘waterfall’ chimney, black porcelain toilet and sink, with full-size tub/shower combination, featuring modern Dornbracht and Hans Grohe fixtures.Upstairs, this large carpeted space is perfect for an in-home office, with an en suite powder room, cedar-lined storage closet, and large walk closet the width of the house at the back. Operable skylights flank the sloped ceiling to let in light, fresh air and views toward the south. But the piest de resistance is the floating diamond plate seating area under the dormer, held up by a cast iron ionic column below. The views from this contemplation corner are expansive to the south and west.Towards the back of the main floor, the dining room opens up to a brand new, renovated kitchen featuring a decorative tiled fireplace and all-white modern hi-gloss cabinets and caesarstone square edges countertop and backsplash with a built-in 20 bottle wine cooler frigidaire. The modern stainless steel farm sink has a goose-neck faucet with braided cable pull-out spray and air-button activated disposal. The high-tech, multi-level Zephyr hood tops the 4 burner/1 griddle Frigidaire gas free-standing oven. The Fisher Paytel stainless steel refrigerator/freezer flanks the entry to the Pantry, with a new Whirlpool stacked washer/dryer machine towards the back and plenty of space for storage.There is a private ‘patio’ off the Dining Room and the back stairs lead to the spacious shared backyard with lush plants, a giant yucca ‘tree’, flowering bougeonvilla vine, vegetable box, stone path and the main feature - a large multi-level deck with a beautiful italian marble outdoor dining table and chairs and heater, planters and a lounge chair area on the lower deck - the perfect place to sit and relax with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, watching the sunset.This is truly a unique and extraordinary home for those that don’t want to live in an ordinary flat.

A completely renovated and retro-fitted duplex cottage built by the owner's grandfather in 1920.  Built behind another small apartment building so the sound of Lombard cannot be heard!	You must see it to believe it. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on this renovation.	Designed like a condo with top of the line appliances, new cabinetry, refinished hardwood floors, high ceilings and completely remodeled bathroom - everything was redone. 	The bedrooms have custom closets with great storage space. The bathroom was designed with multiple drawers in the vanity with 3 part medicine cabinet.  	A private deck right off the kitchen makes for impromptu dining experiences with the view of the landscaped garden and multiple fruit trees.	You can use the additional common patio for private gatherings with owner reservation. This is the upper unit of a duplex cottage.	Thousands of dollars were spent on insulation and noise reduction materials. It feels like your own house.	This is top notch - you will not find a better value in the Marina. The best place to live in the City! Express bus to downtown in 20 minutes. 	Walk 1 block to Chestnut Street for coffee, restaurants and bars. Walk 2 blocks to Union Street for boutique shopping and MORE restaurants, coffee houses and bars!	Utilities paid by tenant. Bike storage in garage is provided.

A response asking if it is still available, or will you consider a short-term stay will not receive a response. THANK YOU!                                  San Francisco - Oceanfront share at Ocean Beach.It is a 2 Bedroom 2 Bathroom fully furnished and equipped condo to be shared with a late 30’s GAM, along with his partner who will actually be spending most of the next 12 months or longer living in a secondary residence on the east coast to be closer to work. So mostly for your new roommate, we are looking for one nice LGBT-friendly person. The Ideal roommate does not work from home or bring the party home. It is a comfortable shoeless home to be shared by pretty much just the two of you who will share all of the common space.Big open living area with a fully stocked and equipped modern kitchen. There is a large outdoor, Oceanfront courtyard with a BBQ, and a gym/exercise room shared by all residents of the complex. Huge views of the beach and ocean from our Great Room Windows. Bicycle room storage is available. One assigned parking garage spot is available at a $100 monthly cost if needed. We do have an in-unit Washer and Dryer for added convenience.We are Oceanfront between La Playa Street and the Great Highway just a stone’s throw from Safeway. Muni Service is out front for the 5 and the 5R (Rapid) heading downtown. Soon to be back in service again (hopefully) will be the 31, the 31AX (express) to downtown, and the 18 headed towards Stonestown. Our neighbors are the Golden Gate Park, The Sutro Dunes, Sutro Heights Park, Sutro Baths, and Lands end. We are surrounded by the best natural beauty that San Francisco has to offer.Available is your bedroom (pictured here), and what will be your own adjacent full bath at a cost of $1575. Your bedroom has a full-sized closet, a flat-screen TV and a work/cafe table with 2 chairs. There will be a PG&E and a Comcast High-Speed WiFi 50/50 share with no other costs or anything to be contracted for. All 3 of our TV’s including the larger living room one, get free, over the air TV, and or use your Chromecast or other streaming devices as you like.It is not the cheapest roommate share, but likely one of the best. What sets this share apart is how nice and comfortably furnished every room is, and how much space there is to be shared by pretty much just the two of you easy to get along with roommates. Occupancy is available as of June 1st. Preference is given to a long-term roommate share situation. Although there is not a dog living here now, a roommate who does have one, already house trained, might be considered. So if interested please send just one detailed email and then we can chat over the phone to avoid all back and forth emails.Great beach weather is coming. If you like beach volleyball or surfing, or just want to live oceanfront in San Francisco, this is the spot for you. Life at the beach is better!

It is undergoing a mini-facelift including a new paint job. It will be available for occupancy around July 1st. Close to Inner Richmond commercial areas with shopping and dining Other than its exceptional condition and the fact that there is a new structural slab (earthquake proofing), this 3 story corner building is quite typical of those built in 1926. This is a bright and spacious (about 875 sf) 1st floor corner unit; It faces the trees and lawn that borders Park Presidio Boulevard. Hardwood floors and double paned windows throughout. An entry hall and foyer imparts a sense of 1920s decadence. There are 3 closets that total about 60 sf of space. Some people have even set up a mini-office with a desk and computer in one of the larger closets. A map, at the end of the picture section, shows views from where the pictures were taken in each room.Kitchen (Pics 1, 2, 9) was updated 6 years ago; new light fixtures, gas stove, lots of cabinet space and ample counter space; a separate eating area with hardwood floors. The kitchen and adjacent eating area would be what one might find in a small house in the area.  No dishwasher or garbage disposal, but a garbage chute is conveniently located just feet from the rear (kitchen) door. Bathroom (Pics 7, 8) has original tile with a shower over tub and a linen closet; new lighting and plumbing fixtures. The other two rooms are extremely large, with new light fixtures and refinished hardwood floors. Either can be used for a bedroom, and the other for a living room or dining room. One is 15' x 17' (Pics 4, 12) and the other is 15' x 20' (Pics 3, 10, 11). Remodeled laundry facilities on the entry floor. For freeway access, it is conveniently located right across from Park Presidio Boulevard, easy access to freeways 101 North to Marin and 101 South to the Peninsula.

Location:The sprawling Richmond district runs across the entire northern border of Golden Gate Park. The Inner Richmond sits above the eastern section of the park and like its neighbors, is renowned for its foggy skies and brisk weather — natural to this region in such close proximity to the Pacific Ocean.The residential streets of the Inner Richmond are lined with a variety of housing styles ranging from single-family abodes to multi-unit properties. From the sand dunes, the region emerged after the 1906 Earthquake as a heavily residential district with long strips of commercial offerings. Some of the original family-owned storefronts remain intact today alongside homeowners whose families have called the Inner Richmond home for more than a century.The Inner Richmond is notable for its many authentic Chinese restaurants. You can also find a number of other cultural cuisines represented along Clement Street including Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Korean foods as well as a variety of produce markets.Similar to other large districts in San Francisco like Noe Valley or the Mission, the Inner Richmond has a little bit of everything to please everyone, minus the hype and high price tag. The main drags of the Inner Richmond that carry over from the west are home to destination restaurants, mom-and-pop essential stores, book stores, beauty salons, and home décor shops.The Inner Richmond is heavy in history and culture, a great place for people looking for a residential core with a big city commercial and cultural flair.Jackie Tom - Leasing Agent/Broker for Owner License # 01349629 / Broker Rentals In SF 1318 Hayes Street San Francisco CA 94117.Rental listings subject to change at any time.

A whole fridge for just two people?  Only one other person to share the bathroom, kitchen, backyard…? Pet-friendly. Reserved parking. Backyard. Storage. Available for move-in anytime in June.The house is in sunny Bayview, it has 2 master bedrooms (12’x11’ and 12.5’x10), 1 bathroom, plus other rooms we can use however we choose – I’m thinking media room and a guest bedroom? The rent is $1800 plus 50/50 split on PG&E, water, and internet. There is also a refundable $1800 deposit. Minimum 3-month contract that can then go month-to-month at the same price if you like. My recent roommate was amazing but she moved to Colorado and then I'm just now moving into this place. I’m going to miss her.The house itself is a one-story Victorian. The ceilings are high and there’s an incredible backyard with artificial turf, a fire pit, a small shed, and an ADU-room. The entire exterior was just painted. All new stainless-steel fridge with icemaker and filtered water, touchscreen gas stove, low-profile microwave, the fanciest dishwasher I’ve ever seen, granite counter-tops, disposal, Lutron LED lighting, Nest thermostat, double-pane windows, fancy washer/dryer, tankless water-heater, security front and back doors. It’s a historic home but it’s obviously been really well-maintained and very recently upgraded. Your room could come furnished if you like (or not). Similarly, I have most if not all of the furnishings we need (couches, vacuum and carpet cleaner, plenty of art, tons of cookware and kitchen stuff, a media center, tools, lots of shelving and bookcases, etc.), but I can sell anything we end up having extra of, or anything we don’t end up needing. The T-line and 3rd St are 1 block away and CCSF is one block away in the other direction. There is easy street parking in the neighborhood for our guests but you and we have reserved off-street spots for us right in front of the house.About me:I’m in my late 30’s but have always been an old man at heart. High school teacher. Gay. I enjoy cooking. I am vegan but you by no means need to be vegan/vegetarian. I love hiking and go on frequent hikes with my dogs. I have two awesome little dachshund-mix rescues. They’re very social, quiet, and cuddly. Actually, they go to work with me every day. I put way too much of my time and energy into teaching and grading but I do love what I do. I’m fairly extroverted and social, though often less so after teaching all day. Matters of social justice, anti-racism and anti-xenophobia matter a lot to me. I think I’m fairly easy to get along with and I continue to be friends with all of my past roommates. I’m sex-positive and open-minded about most things. I don’t really work out or anything but I try to be healthy … kind of. Haha. I enjoy being around people who are different than me and around people that I can learn and grow from. What else…? I’m fairly clean especially in shared spaces though, overall, I am pretty laid back and tend to go off my roommate when it comes to chores and cleaning.About you:I think that a good housemate is a good communicator – you keep the lines of communication open about what you want and need. You’re mature, respectful, and considerate. You must love dogs - my 2 dogs are easy to love but if you just tolerate dogs then this might not be the best match for you. Let me know if you have pets and we can talk out the logistics, but I’m very open to it. If you are LGB, trans or queer, you are more than welcome. You are also very welcome regardless of your age, gender, race/ethnicity, spiritual views, or politics. Obviously, that’s legally the case but I actually mean it as well. Even if you are from a less-than-common background or you have uncommon needs, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’re of course welcome to have over dates and friends but no one should be lowkey living in the house with us. In general, just be kind, flexible, and responsible. Do your part in keeping the house clean and kept up. It goes without saying that you need to pay rent on time.If all of this sounds like it might be a good possibility for you, send me a message and we can set up a phone call or something. I’m hoping we can become friends and not just have a live-and-sleep-in-the-same-house vibe if possible – now that I think about it, my roommates and I have always become friends and kept in touch after moving on to other things.Let me know if you have any questions and good luck in your housing search.

Noe Valley is a quaint, in-demand place to live. The neighborhood features tidy rows of Victorian and Edwardian homes, and thanks to surrounding hills, has some of the city’s sunniest weather. Stroller pushers and dog walkers jostle along 24th Street, which is stocked with bakeries, wine and cheese shops and relaxed cafes. A weekly farmers' market is held in the modest town square. One of the attractions of Noe Valley is that the adjacent Twin Peaks partly blocks the coastal fog and cool winds from the Pacific, making the microclimate usually sunnier and warmer than surrounding neighborhoods.Traffic flow is limited – one main north access through Castro Street to Eureka Valley, one main west access up Clipper Street toward the former Twin Peaks toll plaza and west of the city, several east accesses to the Mission District through 24th Street, Cesar Chavez, and other numbered streets, and the main north–south Church Street access used by the J Church Muni Light Rail.Public transit includes the J Church, which runs down Church Street until 30th Street. The 24 Muni Bus also runs through Noe Valley. Its route comes from the north on Castro Street and switches to Noe Street at 26th Street. It then exits the neighborhood via 30th Street. Additionally, the 48 Muni Bus runs down 24th street, connecting the neighborhood to the nearby Mission District. The neighborhood is primarily residential, although there are two bustling commercial strips, the first along 24th Street, between Church Street and Diamond Street, and the second, less dense corridor along Church Street, between 24th Street and 30th Street.This apartment features the following:1st floor unit\Fully remodeledHardwood floors throughoutGranite CountertopStainless Steel refrigerator, stove, microwave includedForce air heatingWasher and Dryer in unitBackyardPlenty of cabinet space and storageBath with tub/shower comboBeautiful TileModern fixturesEasy street parking with SFMTA permit.This is a non-smoking unit.Details:Floors: HardwoodKitchen: Standard - Electric / GasLaundry: In UnitParking: Street with SFMTAUtilities include: NonePets: No Pets.Rental Terms: 12 monthsRent: $4295.00 + UtilitiesAvailable: ImmediatelyApplication Fee: $25.00 per applicantSecurity Deposit: $4295.00 OACLocation:3891A 25th St. San Francisco, CA 94114To Apply:Online applicationCopy of each applicant's drivers licensesProof of income: Last 3 months of paycheck stubsCredit check$25.00 Application fee per applicant over the age of 18Please contact:Ben  show contact infoEqual Housing Opportunity Provider    ",https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/d/san-francisco-bed-bath-noe-valley/7331460932.html

Safeway is just about across the street and we are surrounded by the best of San Francisco’s natural beauty, the Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Sutro Dunes, Baths, and Park, not to mention Lands End with all the bicycle and hiking trails right here.

Even our In-Unit washer and dryer (no coins needed) is a convenient plus. 1 dedicated parking spot will be made available to you at a cost of $100 per month. Outside of the $1575 rent, you will only share a 50/50 split of PG&E Electric (actual usage only) and a 50/50 split of the Comcast High-Speed Wi-Fi where your cost is just $30. That is it there are no other costs as all else is included.One detailed email will lead to a fast response via a phone call if it looks like you read this entire ad and it looks like a good fit may exist.

One of the members of ""The Kingston Trio"" rented this home for many years in the 1960's.Conveniently located in the southern end of Sausalito in its most desirable neighborhood called ""Old Town"", it's only 4 blocks to the bay and a short walk to picturesque Bridgeway Blvd (which runs along the Sausalito waterfront), the corner market, the waterfront restaurants, and the ferry to downtown San Francisco (takes 25 minutes).  Old Town is so close to the Marina District, Cow Hollow, and Pacific Heights that it's practically another district in San Francisco.This architectural wonder was shipped over from Europe in the 1800's, by a ship captain on his ship.From the moment you open the gorgeously detailed, hand carved heavy wooden front door with the ornate Victorian brass door handle, the interior reveals detailing and craftsmanship that is rarely seen in California.  This spacious home has 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, and is about 1670 square feet of space on 2 entire floors, with a water view of the bay and Angel Island from both floors and an outdoor deck.The Pink House has fancy architectural box ceilings and original period details in the living room, formal dining room and large master bedroom with walk-in closet.  Both the large living room and formal dining room feature shimmering chandeliers and tall ceilings.  The formal dining room and staircase have wainscoting decorating the walls.  There is a breakfast area off of the country style kitchen (a nod to Marin living), and a large private view deck suitable for entertaining, which looks down on a lovely backyard garden and also has city lights views of the Old Town hills and surrounding valley.As we like to say, not only does The Pink House have a view looking outside, but it even has a view on the inside when the blinds are closed.There is a washer and dryer, stainless steel appliances, and quartz countertops in the kitchen.A bike path that heads into Fort Baker, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and the Marin Headlands is just 3 blocks away, and hiking and mountain biking trails are just minutes away.  The Marin Headlands have stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco.  As you know, Marin County was the birthplace of mountain biking.  Invite your friends over to watch the Sausalito and San Francisco July 4th fireworks displays from Bridgeway, and the Blue Angels jets during the annual Fleet Week performing their acrobatics over the bay between San Francisco and Sausalito.The Pink House is only 20 minutes from the Financial District in San Francisco, and is closer to downtown than many districts in San Francisco are.  Sausalito is the first town north of San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge.  The Pink House is only 7 minutes drive to San Francisco.  So imagine quickly hopping over the Golden Gate Bridge to return to your bay view dream home just minutes from the bridge, in a town that people come to visit from all over the world which is often compared to Portofino, Italy.It's just 3 blocks to the Golden Gate Transit bus stop, which regularly travels to/from downtown San Francisco with free wi-fi aboard all buses.You can experience one of the world's most magnificent commutes every day on the ferry across the bay to the Ferry Building at the foot of Market Street in San Francisco - it also stops at Pier 41 at Fisherman's Wharf. The ferries have free Wi-fi inside, and a full bar. Imagine coming home sipping a  Chardonnay while enjoying the gorgeous sunset and the Golden Gate Bridge, and stunning views of the city and bay every day. There's nothing like the smell of clean salt air to invigorate for the rest of the day.There is a big discount for ferry commuters using the Clipper Card - $7.25 instead of $13.50.The Manzanita Park and Ride is only 10 minutes away at the north end of Sausalito next to Hwy 101, where many of the large tech company shuttles pick up their employees and take them to offices in San Francisco and Silicon Valley/San Jose.Why live in San Francisco with all of the noise and congestion, where you're fortunate to get a place with ""lots of light"" in a building pressed right up against the neighbors, when you can instead come home every day to your architecturally exquisite home in a world-class vacation destination with a beautiful view of the water and Angel Island, and just blocks from the bay?Experience why locals prefer the Sausalito lifestyle, and work at home, in San Francisco, or in Silicon Valley.10-month lease that hopefully you will renew. We hope that you will fall in love with the house and stay for years.Security Deposit is $6,750.Indoor cats and small dog breeds under 20 lbs and under 16"" tall are ok.

Please see photos that hint at this inspirational living environment, inside and outside.There are two rooms:  156 sq. ft., and 210 sq. ft. in this three bedroom flat.  Finely furnished. (see photos) All personal items will be gone, including the piano.  The rooms have closets, tall windows that let in good light, chandeliers, and are quiet.  One bed and a couple chairs can be gone, too.  I am thinking that one of the two available rooms could be an office or music studio.  As the flat has all wooden flooring, acoustics for stringed musical instruments are rich.The well maintained, distinctive Victorian building is situated mid-block on a skinny, cherry tree-lined street, with all conveniences beginning at the corners of the block and continuing. Prime sunny spot in Eureka Valley. The corner health food store, yoga studio, large grocery, tennis court, several public transportation choices are all 2 minutes away. Shops, restaurants, Castro Theater, too.  Easy on-street parking with 'S' sticker.  Walk 5 minutes to Dolores Park.  Great for bicycling.Nice bathroom with 6' claw-foot tub and great shower over it, window, cupboard space, etc.I am a busy visual artist, vegetarian, nature explorer, public radio and classical and jazz appreciator, bicycler, etc., who has rented this flat for 16 years. I have put my heart into it, and towards evolving the shared back gardens (8 flats in the building with very busy professionals)  The photo of the avocados is from a pit I planted early on, and it adorns the back deck. (one flight up)  There is a huge dine-in kitchen with gas stove, lots of empty cupboard and counter space and utensils, etc.  The kitchen has 3 Easterly facing windows and door out to the back deck with furnishings.  It's one flight down to the double-wide lot of back gardens, that I have included a few photos of.  Also: (apple, pomegranate, mandarin orange, lemon, lime, apricot, plum, peach, cherry trees, and assorted berries, and decorative plants)I keep the flat's general areas clean with natural cleaners.  Shoes come off at the front door.Two private rooms, and shared communal spaces with myself.  Monthly rent: $2,400. Utilities are generally $60 - $80/month.

In addition, starting about ½ block away from the flat/building in various and multiple directions, there is regular street parking that is non-metered designed for residents so you don’t have to worry about having to constantly feed meters (last I heard the parking permit fee for these non-metered spaces, which allows you to park for greater than 2 hours, overnight, etc., is $144 per year, or $72 for half-year, so they’re meant for residents and applying I understand is pretty easy).  Lastly, the area is filled with businesses, so street parking spaces change hands and open up quite frequently.LOCATION DETAILS:Near numerous tech and other companies, such as Twitter, Uber, Square, Zynga, Dolby Laboratories, Adobe Systems, etc.The flat/building is located in the heart and midst of one of the most bustling, vibrant, and densely concentrated collection of the hippest and chic restaurants, bistros, bars, night clubs, art galleries, wine merchants, boutiques, lounges, night spots, theaters, both specialty and large groceries, and host of other commercial businesses, in all of San Francisco.

The exterior of the building has a stunning European-looking flair ! There are only 2 Residential and 1 Commercial (ground floor Cleaners) units in the building, on 3 floors. The interior hallway and stairs to the two residential flats have rich colors, and beautiful ornamental lights throughout.A LOT MORE ABOUT THE 4 BR UNIT on the 2nd Floor : (Follow the floorplan diagram provided in the photos) As you reach the 2nd floor landing (3 floors in total) and open the front door, you will be greeted by warm hardwood floors and beautiful new paint throughout the apartment. The ceilings are about 11 feet high and have very nice vaulted details. Close the front door, and look to your Left (due North) and Right (due South, towards Market Street) to the beautiful and long Victorian hallway. To your immediate RIGHT is the entry to the SUNROOM and the LIVING ROOM (both facing Market Street) : .The SUNROOM has high ceilings, large vinyl double-glazed windows for insulation, and a large 2nd level /loft area for storage.LIVING ROOMNow walk back to the Master hallway, facing towards the end of the building, and turn immediately to the first doorway on your RIGHT.
