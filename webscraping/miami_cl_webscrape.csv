Come view this beautiful home situated on a corner lot on a quiet, cul-de-sac street!The home offers a split floorplan with an open, central kitchen and living space featuring warm Mexican tile.  The roomy master bedroom has two walk-in closets with custom built-in storage and a large bathroom with Jacuzzi tub and separate shower.  The bright living space has a vaulted ceiling with plenty of natural light and french doors that open to a portico by the large pool.The yard is fully fenced in with tall hedges providing plenty of privacy and the large gate on the side allows access to park a boat or RV. On the back of the property is a serene outdoor shower for when you want to enjoy the beautiful South Florida weather! The updated kitchen provides plenty of space for cooking big meals with family and friends without bumping into one another and even has a large drink and coffee bar, along with a wine cooler, that provides additional storage.
